# Load the datasets

```{r}

counties_demographics <- readRDS(here("data", "counties_demographics.rds"))

counties_rural_urban_suburban <- readRDS(here("data", "counties_rural_urban_suburban.rds"))

# Exercises

Join together the election results and urban/suburban/rural tables above, and then use the merged table to:

-   filter for just Virginia

-   group/summarize to calculate the mean pct of Trump 2020 vote by urban/rural categories

```{r}

joined_counties <- inner_join(counties_elexresults, counties_rural_urban_suburban, by = "geoid")

joined_counties_virginia <- joined_counties %>% 
  filter(state_code == "VA")

va_trumpvote_byurbanrural <- joined_counties_virginia %>% 
  group_by(rural_urban) %>% 
  summarise(mean_vote_percentage = mean(pct_r_2020))

va_trumpvote_byurbanrural


```

Take the grouped dataset, and create a column chart using ggplot to display it

```{r}

ggplot(va_trumpvote_byurbanrural, aes(x = reorder(rural_urban, mean_vote_percentage), y = mean_vote_percentage)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "lightblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Avg Vote (by Pct)", labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "County Type") +
  labs(title = "Trump Percent of the Vote in Virginia ", 
       subtitle = "Average in Urban/Suburban/Rural Counties") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Now using the joined dataset, come up with two groupings you find interesting or newsworthy in a particular state, and replicate the steps above them them instead.

(i.e. instead of for urban/rural, perhaps you want to look at pct of white college grads in Michigan, etc. If you're having trouble, you can stick with Virginia as your state.)

```{r}

joined_counties <- inner_join(counties_elexresults, counties_rural_urban_suburban, by = "geoid")
joined_counties_virginia <- joined_counties %>% 
  filter(state_code == "PA")
hillary_vote_2016 <- joined_counties %>% 
  group_by(rural_urban) %>% 
  summarise(mean_vote_percentage = mean(pct_d_2016))
hillary_vote_2016


```


```{r}


print('comment')
